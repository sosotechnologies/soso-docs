### What is Cloud Computing? 
Cloud computing is the use of hosted services, such as servers, data storage, databases, software, and networking over the internet¬ — instead of directly accessing your computer hard drive.

### Types of cloud computing
Cloud computing is offered in 3 major forms: private, public, and hybrid cloud.

- Private Cloud
    - The private cloud computing service is a cloud computing model where the infrastructure is dedicated only to select users instead of the general public, either over the Internet or a private internal network. Other names for the private cloud are internal or corporate cloud. Some private cloud providers are VMware-vRealize Suite Cloud Management Platform, AWS-Virtual Private Cloud, Microsoft-Azure Private Cloud…

- Public Cloud
    - The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume. Some public cloud services are AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud…

- Hybrid Cloud
    - A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines an on-premises data center (also called a private cloud) with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Some public cloud providers are VMware, Microsoft Azure…
